- Put everything in stuff/Brewfile... some where

- Keyboard layout
- Keyboard shortcuts

- Enable all the input field things tabable
- Make spaces not shuffle around
- Disable restoring after restart (I think I'm probably sick of this?)

# Stuff that you've done that still needs to be enscripted somewhere
- Disable caps lock
- Make Safari open things in new windows
- Terminal theme?
